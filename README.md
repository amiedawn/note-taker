## Description: 

This application saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file. The front end was created by University of Arizona Full-Stack Web Development Boot Camp. My job was to build the back end, connect the two, and deploy the application to Heroku.

## Installation Instructions:

You will need to install Node.js, npm, express, fs, and uuid before running this application. Clone the repository at https://github.com/amiedawn/note-taker . Then install the Node.js and the other necessary packages. Finally run the application in the terminal by typing “node start” and opening "localhost:3001" in the web browser.
